# 🚗 Car Sales Dashboard – Excel & Power BI Project

This is a car sales analysis project I worked on using Excel and Power BI. The goal was to turn raw sales data into something visual and interactive to easily understand trends, top-performing car brands, and customer preferences.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Excel** – For initial data cleaning, formatting, and some basic calculations.
- **Power BI** – Used to build the dashboard and visualizations.

## 📊 What the Dashboard Shows

- **Total Sales (YTD & MTD)** – Gives an overview of year-to-date and monthly sales performance.
- **Average Sale Value & Units Sold** – Shows how many units are sold and their average price.
- **Weekly Trends** – A line chart that helps track sales patterns over time.
- **Sales by Body Style** – Breakdown by SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.
- **Sales by Color** – Which car colors are selling most.
- **Top Brands** – Company-wise comparison (Chevrolet, Ford, Volkswagen, etc.).
- **Dealer Region Map** – Shows how different regions are performing.
- **Slicers** – Easy filters to break data down by body style, region, engine type, and transmission.

## ✅ How I Built It

1. Cleaned and formatted the raw Excel data (fixed dates, removed nulls, formatted values).
2. Imported it into Power BI and built a custom date table for time-based calculations.
3. Created calculated fields like YTD Sales, MTD Sales, Avg Price, Total Units Sold.
4. Designed visuals and added slicers to make the report interactive.

## 🔄 What Can Be Improved

- Could connect it to a live database instead of static Excel data.
- Add forecasting and trend prediction using Power BI features.
- Share the report as an interactive web link or export to PDF for stakeholders.
